				and recieved his certificate from the University of Arizona. During the 6 month course he learned multiple technologies
				to include javascript and git. This also allowed him to work in collaborative efforts with others and make new friends
				in the process!</p>

			<p>He is currently spending his days honing his skills and keeping up with what's new in tech while creating basic sites
				for family and friends in need! </p>
